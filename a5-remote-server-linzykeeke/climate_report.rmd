### Data


##Tell which data we use (see the readme file) and for which purpose.

North American data frame is used to plot out the Temperature and precipitation for the North American maps on January 01, :1960, 1986 and 2014.

### Temperature

#insert your temperature images here.  You can put three plots on a

#single figure but the results will be tiny.  I recommend to use a
separate figure for each year.

#comment the results.  Do the temperature patterns look reasonable?  Do
you see major differences between years?


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('./North-America-1960-temp-map.jpg')
```


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('./North-America-1986-temp-map.jpg')
```


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('./North-America-2014-temp-map.jpg')
```
### Precipitation

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot() + geom_point(data = north_america %>% filter(north_america$time == '1960-01-01'), aes(x=longtitude, y=latitude, col= percipitation)) +
  coord_map()

ggplot() + geom_point(data = north_america %>% filter(north_america$time == '1986-01-01'), aes(x=longtitude, y=latitude, col= percipitation)) +
  coord_map()
ggplot() + geom_point(data = north_america %>% filter(north_america$time == '2014-01-01'), aes(x=longtitude, y=latitude, col= percipitation)) +
  coord_map()
```
comment the results.  Do the precipitation patterns look reasonable?  Do
you see major differences between years?


### Note: 

you cannot do any conclusions about long-term trend based on just 3
figures.  If you are interested, you are welcome to explore long-term
trends in these data, but be sure to use more suitable methods.
